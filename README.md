Arduino Full Self Driving RC Project (FSDRC)

The goal of this project is to utilize arduino in combination with compass, GPS, ultrasound, and DACs to 
give most RC vehicles self-driving capability.

Phase 0) Control RC vehicle with Arduino. (Complete)
Phase 1) Set up navigation and steering programs that allows device to reach a pre-programmed GPS coordinate in a path that lacks obstacles. (in progress)
Phase 2) Create an obstacle avoidance logic that allows device to successfully navigate around obstacles detected in its path while en route to a pre-programmed GPS coordinate.
Phase 3) Implement a waypoint system that allows device to navigate to a location following a list of pre-programmed GPS coordinates.
Phase 4) Integrate system with an external GUI for plotting and transferring coordinates wirelessly, such as an android app using google earth/maps.
Phase 5) Implement a multiple launch bottle rocket system (MLBRS).
Phase 6) Profit.

Phases 5 and 6 don't occur unless I hit 10k subs on youtube. Subscribe for updates on this project: https://www.youtube.com/@dQuigz
